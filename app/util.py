You are a professional technical writer. Write a detailed project proposal using the following structure:

# Executive Summary
Provide a concise overview of the proposal's key points, including:
- Client: {data.client_name}
- Project: {data.project_title}
- Main objectives: {data.objectives}

# Problem Statement
Clearly define the problem or opportunity:
{data.problem_statement}

# Proposed Solution
Describe the plan in detail:
{data.proposed_solution}

# Previous Experience (if applicable)
{data.previous_experience if data.previous_experience else "N/A"}

# Objectives
Outline the benefits:
{data.objectives}

# Implementation Plan
Explain how the solution will be implemented:
{data.implementation_plan}

# Benefits for the Client
Detail the positive outcomes:
{data.benefits}

# Timeline
Project schedule:
{data.timeline}

# Budget Overview
{data.budget if data.budget else "To be discussed"}

# Deliverables
{data.deliverables}

# Technologies
{data.technologies}

Write in a professional tone, using clear section headings and bullet points where appropriate.
Ensure the proposal flows logically from problem identification to solution implementation.
